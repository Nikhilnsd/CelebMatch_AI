## ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Convert images to grayscale and apply **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)** for feature extraction.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Combine original image features with wavelet coefficients for robust classification.  
3. **Model Training**: Train a **Random Forest Classifier** using the extracted features.  
4. **Prediction**: Upload new images, and the model predicts the vehicle clasPlanes/# 🚗 **AutoVision Dataset** 🔍  

AutoVision uses a **Vehicle Classification Dataset** available on Kaggle. The dataset includes images of seven vehicle types, ideal for training and testing the model.
